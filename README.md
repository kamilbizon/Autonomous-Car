# Autonomous-Car
#### Our project is designed to teach convolutional neural network (CNN) steer a car by cloning human drivers behaviour. We use program provided by Udacity which allow to get images and steering data (human drive) in tranining mode and let CNN steer a car in autonomous mode.

## Getting started
#### The simplest way to install all dependencies is install 64bit Anaconda with Pyhthon 3.6 version. Then run Anaconda Prompt and install all dependencies with:  
```
conda env create -f car.yml
```
Installing everything manually is not recommended.
